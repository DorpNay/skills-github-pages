# aLandi — Project Orchestrator

**Purpose:** one compact navigation index for the owner's principles, source catalogs, goals, plans, decisions, and current repository-state records. It is an index, not a second backlog or a replacement for live GitHub evidence.

## Normative principles and execution method

- **aLandi principles / N₂O constitution:** [docs/ALANDI_N2O_CORE_RU.md](docs/ALANDI_N2O_CORE_RU.md) — authority, evidence, safety, capability contracts, status semantics, and quality.
- **Knowledge cycle:** [docs/ALANDI_N2O_KNOWLEDGE_LOOP_RU.md](docs/ALANDI_N2O_KNOWLEDGE_LOOP_RU.md) — capture, verify, evaluate, promote/revise/defer/reject.
- **Concise engineering loop:** [LOOP.md](LOOP.md) — execute, verify, record, rollback, handoff.
- **Executor rules:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- **Owner handoff / authority / routing:** [OLEDUE.md](OLEDUE.md).

## Single inventory of owner goals

- **Master task registry:** [docs/MASTER_TASK_REGISTRY_RU.md](docs/MASTER_TASK_REGISTRY_RU.md) — lossless historical inventory with stable IDs.
- **Append-only owner/capability additions:** [docs/MASTER_TASK_REGISTRY_ADDENDUM_2026-11-02_RU.md](docs/MASTER_TASK_REGISTRY_ADDENDUM_2026-11-02_RU.md).
- **UI requirements and acceptance:** [docs/V1_UI_FINALIZATION_RU.md](docs/V1_UI_FINALIZATION_RU.md), especially owner corrections §§8.1–8.17 and subsequent sections.
- **Current release sequencing:** [docs/LANDING_RELEASE_STRATEGY_RU.md](docs/LANDING_RELEASE_STRATEGY_RU.md) and [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_RU.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_RU.md).
- **Release gates:** owner-controlled [Issue #111](https://github.com/DorpNay/skills-github-pages/issues/111).

## External-source catalogs and adoption evidence

- **Full source inventory:** [INTEL.md](INTEL.md) (stable EXT IDs, upstream/provenance and evidence).
- **Source triage / license and adoption boundaries:** [docs/OPEN_SOURCE_TRIAGE_RU.md](docs/OPEN_SOURCE_TRIAGE_RU.md).
- **Technique and reusable-method register:** [docs/TECHNIQUE_REGISTER_RU.md](docs/TECHNIQUE_REGISTER_RU.md).
- **Evaluation contracts:** [EVALS.md](EVALS.md).
- **Architecture decisions:** [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
- **Artifact/license provenance:** [infra/license/provenance_manifest.yaml](infra/license/provenance_manifest.yaml).

External research records do not mean code/model weights were downloaded, licensed for redistribution, adopted, or enabled. Preserve only owner-approved artifacts with exact upstream revision, applicable code/weight/data license, SHA-256, provenance and storage policy.

## Live state and navigation

- **Current mutable truth:** GitHub main/PR/issues/workflow/deployment APIs, checked fresh at task start.
- **Short checkpoint:** [ORIENTER.md](ORIENTER.md).
- **Detailed path index:** [project-reference/FILE_ORIENTER_RU.md](project-reference/FILE_ORIENTER_RU.md).
- **Structured state:** [docs/PROJECT_STATE.yaml](docs/PROJECT_STATE.yaml).
- **Machine checkpoint:** [docs/project-state-snapshot.json](docs/project-state-snapshot.json).
- **Stage evidence / decisions:** [docs/VOLLEY_LOG.md](docs/VOLLEY_LOG.md).
- **GitHub Pages publication evidence:** check exact main SHA's Pages deployment and the public URL with a cache-busting query; build/CI success alone is not deployment proof.

## Owner goal intake (mandatory, lightweight)

For every newly stated owner goal:
1. Search the existing Master Task Registry and UI checklist for the requirement or overlap.
2. If an ID exists, enrich it with the new constraint/detail; otherwise append one stable task ID to the existing addendum.
3. Preserve lower-priority goals and their status when execution order changes. Never silently drop a request or create a parallel backlog.
4. Begin one safe bounded implementation/check in the same work cycle whenever possible. Record exact SHA, checks, limits and next step.
5. Update only the canonical records whose material facts changed. Keep the checkpoint compact to reduce repeated work and handoff burden.

## Current owner priority override — 2026-11-07

1. **N₂O/task-intake:** principles, owner authority and single task register remain canonical; GitHub live state wins over historical checkpoint text.
2. **GitHub Pages — VERIFIED LIVE:** exact main `c4f23e03f563d03213eb87002863da630fc8b833`; deployment #42372745873 SUCCESS; official managed Jekyll build v1.0.13, artifact upload and Deploy passed. Quality #42372746360 SUCCESS on the same SHA; 116 Chromium app tests, published root smoke 1/1, landing 8/8, and exact build-revision checks passed on ordinary canonical root and `/landing/` URLs without cache-busting. No duplicate deployment workflow is needed.
3. **UI §8.17 — IMPLEMENTED / MERGED:** PR #166 merged at `c4f23e03f563d03213eb87002863da630fc8b833`; settings expose message font size, line spacing and standard/high-contrast modes. In the app, open the global gear/settings → “Читаемость текста”. §8.1 sidebar swipe-to-close is already merged via PR #161. Broader UI work remains active; PR #154 is stale/diverged and its previous Quality/Freshness runs failed. Reconcile its work in small exact-head slices while preserving #147/#148/#150 contracts; no wholesale merge or weakened tests.
4. **External sources — DOCUMENTED / RESEARCH ONLY:** owner list and exact upstream/licensing/security triage are in `INTEL.md` and `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_TRIAGE_RU.md`; no download/install/code copy/runtime adoption was authorized.
5. Continue all remaining registry goals (bounded source evaluations, voice/document work, continuity and verified cleanup) without erasing lower-priority scope or creating a parallel backlog.
